    <h3>Delicious shakshuka recipe for dinner</h3>
    <p>This shakshuka is a tomato-y one-skillet poached eggs dish that's full of all the flavors that you can imagine.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>6 eggs, or more as needed</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
      <li>1 cup diced onion</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon minced garlic</li>
      <li>1 (8 ounce) jar roasted red bell peppers, drained and chopped</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons Hunt's® Tomato Paste</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon chili powder</li>
      <li>½ cup water</li>
      <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    
    <ol>
      <li>
        Heat oil in skillet over medium heat. Saute onions until translucent and tender, 
        about 5 minutes. Add chopped roasted pepper and garlic; saute until garlic releases its fragrance,
        1 or 2 minutes longer. Stir in tomato paste, chili powder and ancho chili powder, cumin, and paprika.
        Saute for another minute or so until well combined.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir in Hunt's® Diced Tomatoes and water. Season with salt and pepper.
        Raise heat to medium-high and bring mixture to a boil.
        Immediately reduce heat to medium and cook about 5 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Reduce heat to medium-low. Make a well for each egg and pour 1 egg into each well.
        Cover; poach until whites are firm and yolks have thickened but are not hard, 2 1/2 to 5 minutes.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Cook's note</h3>
    <i>Serving size depends on the amount of eggs you want to poach. If they are large,
       only 5 or 6 will fit. I now use medium eggs to get more servings with more sauce. Yum!</i>
